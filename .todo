### Model

- [] add species group as either table or add to deployment model (verify in access for this decision)
- [] add has many relation (species_group->sample_unit)
- [] add belongs to relation (sample_unit->species_group)
- [] add tests to show that dependent destroy interactions are working correctly
- [] refactor detector location spec test for callback function
- [] refactor sample unit tests and test groupings
- [] use the data from "xrefSpeciesSpeciesGroup.csv" as a way to build the relationships when creating species and species groups
- [x] add microphone type as either table or add to deployment model (verify in access for this decision)
- [x] add distance range as either table or add to deployment model (verify in access for this decision)
- [x] add tests for clutter type associations
- [x] add tests for clutter percent associations
- [x] look into combining orientation into associated models
- [x] recovery contact is just a contact with a deployment attached to it. make a recovery contact (Found a nice solution for this)
- [x] add clutter type to either the deployment model or make a look up table if there are many
- [x] create detector locations table and it's associations
- [x] add has many relation (detection_target->detector_location)
- [x] add belongs to relation (detector_location->detection_target)
- [x] add has many relation (target_descriptor->detector_location)
- [x] add belongs to relation (detector_location->target_descriptor)
- [x] ensure that contacts have all specified relationships and they are tested
- [x] finish modeling software
- [x] put software model under test
- [x] add detector location model (belongs to sample unit)
- [x] add belongs to relation (detector_location->sample_unit)
- [x] add has many relation (sample_unit->detector_location)
- [x] figure out if recovery contact is an organization or if it should inherit through contact
- [x] remove "FederalAgency" field from sample_unit

### Data

- [] add species and species group models where they have a many to many relationship
- [] update all seeding data using current access data
- [x] look into new sample unit data to see what must be done to use that instead of the current sample unit set
- [x] add detector location seeding data and seed it
- [x] add extra columns to detector locations from the data
- [x] add fake detector data to build test database
- [x] swap out activerecord-import for the new rails 6 method of bulk building data from pre made datasets (activerecord-import is better for our use case)
- [x] finishing cleaning sample unit data

### Workflow

- [] convert upload workflow to use manually made upload form
- [] ensure that tests are correctly testing all portions of the workflow
- [x] add test for workflow
- [x] add workflow for parsing data
- [x] make sure that workflow is fully unit tested

General
- [] swap out custom component use to the system used by github
- [] add user login using devise
- [] normalize table create file and class names
- [] normalize names to either use label or name across models
- [x] add ERD to readme
