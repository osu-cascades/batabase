Data TODOs
- [] add fake detector data to build test database
- [] finishing cleaning sample unit data
- [] create detector locations table and it's associations
- [] add has many relation (detection_target->detector_location)
- [] add belongs to relation (detector_location->detection_target)
- [] add has many relation (target_descriptor->detector_location)
- [] add belongs to relation (detector_location->target_descriptor)
- [] add species group as either table or add to deployment model (verify in access for this decision)
- [] add distance range as either table or add to deployment model (verify in access for this decision)
- [] add microphone type as either table or add to deployment model (verify in access for this decision)
- [] add clutter type to either the deployment model or make a look up table if there are many
- [] finish modeling software
- [] put software model under test
- [] add detector location model (belongs to sample unit)
- [] add belongs to relation (detector_location->sample_unit)
- [] add has many relation (sample_unit->detector_location)
- [] figure out if recovery contact is an organization or if it should inherit through contact
- [] add has many relation (species_group->sample_unit)
- [] add belongs to relation (sample_unit->species_group)
- [] add species and species group models where they have a many to many relationship
- [] use the data from "xrefSpeciesSpeciesGroup.csv" as a way to build the relationships when creating species and species groups
