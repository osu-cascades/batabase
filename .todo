- [x] add has many relation (detection_target->detector_location)
- [x] add belongs to relation (detector_location->detection_target)
- [x] add has many relation (target_descriptor->detector_location)
- [x] add belongs to relation (detector_location->target_descriptor)
- [] add species group as either table or add to deployment model (verify in access for this decision)
- [] add distance range as either table or add to deployment model (verify in access for this decision)
- [] add microphone type as either table or add to deployment model (verify in access for this decision)
- [] add clutter type to either the deployment model or make a look up table if there are many
- [x] finish modeling software
- [x] put software model under test
